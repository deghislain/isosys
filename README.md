PROJECT TITLE: Isolette System

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Every day a few babies come into this world before the 52 weeks that characterize a normal woman pregnancy.
For these newborns called preterm babies, medical staff has to provide a temporary environment that will help them complete their 
growth. The Isolette Software System (ISS), is the piece of software that run on top of a device also known as incubator, and that
provide a such environment.
The incubator main role is to provide to a baby an environment similar to which that was provided by its mother before the
  premature birth, that means a controlled temperature, controlled oxygen, and controlled humidity. In order to achieve that, ISS uses an operator interface that helps set the temperatures boundaries, and two distinct functions to monitor and regulate those parameters in perfect interaction with others isolette's components, such as Heat Source and Temperature Sensor.
